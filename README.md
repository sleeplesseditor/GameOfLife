# Game of Life

This is a recreation of Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It's built using React and with guidance from the FreeCodeCamp tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM0_Er3SvFQ&index=16&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmDGFE_pZ-PDJ1GWe3KtT-M).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd GameofLife
2) npm install
3) npm start
